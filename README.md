## Security and Quality Assurance Lab1 - Login Box

Working with your partner, build the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files to create a login box.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. The login form will have two fields, **_“Username”_**, and, **_“Password”_**.
2. There will also be a hidden div under the login box that the JS can output messages to.
3. When the user clicks submit, the values entered for Username and Password will be displayed in the output div:

    **Username:** _{value}_

    **Password:** _{value}_

4. If a field is empty on submit, the user should be able to tell visually which field is invalid, and the focus should be set there.
5. No further validation is required.
6. Element classes and names must follow the BEM naming convention.
7. The JavaScript must validate to JSLint standards (Under Options, check Assume… a browser and add ‘window’ to the Global Variables box. Do NOT select Tolerate…whitespace mess!)
